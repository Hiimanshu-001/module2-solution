			<p id="p">Itachi Uchiha:</p>
			<p id="pc">People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That's how they define ‘reality’. But what does it mean to be ‘correct’ or ‘true’? Merely vague concepts... Their ‘reality’ may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs?</p>

			<p id="p">Rengoku Kyojuro:</p>
			<p id="pc">No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness, set your heart ablaze. Grit your teeth and look straight ahead. Even if you stop and crouch down, time won’t wait for you or snuggle you and grieve along with you. Don’t feel bad that I’m going to die here. As a Hashira, of course I would shield my juniors. I must do what is my duty. I won’t let anyone know what’s here.</p>

			<p id="p">Pain:</p>
			<p id="pc">“We Are Just Ordinary People Driven To Revenge In The Name Of Justice. But If Revenge Is Called Justice, Then That Justice Breeds Yet More Revenge And Becomes A Chain Of Hatred. Those Who Do Not Understand True Pain Can Never Understand True Peace.</p>
